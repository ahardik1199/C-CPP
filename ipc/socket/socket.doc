A client socket is created with socket[] call, and connected to remote address with connect[] call
and can retrieve data with recv[] call ( socket[] ---> connect[] --->recv[] )

on the Server end of the socket, create a socket with a socket[] call, but then, we need to bind[] that
socket to an IP and port where it can then listen[] for connections, and then finally accept[] a connection
and then send[] or recv[] data to other socket it is connected to.
( socket[] --> bind[] --> listen[] --> accept[] )
